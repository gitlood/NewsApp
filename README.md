Android Basics: Networking App(ud843) - Project

## Project Overview
This app that connects to the Internet to provide news articles on a topic of your choice.

The News feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location.

## Why this project?
I learned about connecting to the internet in Android, parsing responses from an API, updating the information in your app, and properly displaying that information. Practicing these skills is imperative in order to build apps that delight and surprise users by anticipating their needs and supplying them with relevant information.

## What will I learn?
* Connecting to an API
* Parsing the response of the API
* Handling error cases gracefully
* Updating information regularly
* Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle
